# Texture-Generator

A simple script that takes a directory that has psd files in it as input and
outputs png spritesheets in the output directory given.  

The psd files it finds, it splits in to seperate images and then places them on a sprite-sheet.
Tested with python3.8 but probably works with any Python3.6+ version.  

## Instructions

Literaly all it does:

`python path_to_texture_generator/src/main.py --in ./assets/textures --out ./data/textures`
